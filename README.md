## Form-from-hell

When the user loads the page, contact form is displayed asking for some user information. Nothing seems amiss, until we try to 
complete the form. Ridiculous validation appear to each form field. It will be possible to complete each field, but not easy.
Again, user will be be able to actually submit the form, but the process would be so complicated that no user will want to.
When the user finally does submit the form, he is presented with an obnoxious confirmation message.
